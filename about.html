    <h2>What does it take to be a puppy raiser?
        <p>Potential puppy raisers should first consider how much time and patience a puppy needs in general. A guide dog puppy also needs to be worked with regularly to build a solid training foundation to build on. To accomplish this a puppy raiser needs to not only teach basic training, but should also take the opportunities to expose them to all sorts of different settings. This helps build their confidence for situations they may face in the future. 
        <p>Though some things may prove more stressful than others, the thing to remember is that your guide puppy could one day be someone's eyes. That in itself is a reward to see.
