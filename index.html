   <h2>What does Guide Dogs for the Blind do?</h2>
   <p>Guide Dogs for the Blind is an organization that strives to help blind or visually impaired individuals to gain a sense of independence by pairing them with their specially trained dogs. As a team, they learn how to work together and are able to go about their daily activities with a newfound confidence. This creates a strong bond between dog and handler as they build a lasting trust with one another. 
   </p>
   <p>Before they can become guides though, the dogs go through a series of training within their first year. This starts as soon as they are placed with volunteers as puppies. These volunteers are also known as "puppy raisers" and provide the essential foundation training.</p>
